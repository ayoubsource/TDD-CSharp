# Modern C++ Programming with Test-Driven Development - C# Adaptation
## Overview

This repository is dedicated to the adaptation of the book Modern C++ Programming with Test-Driven Development by Jeff Langr to the C# programming language. The aim is to make the principles and practices of Test-Driven Development (TDD) accessible to a broader audience, particularly those within the .NET community.

The project involves reworking all examples from the original book into C#, ensuring that the adaptation remains faithful to the spirit and intent of the original work while making necessary adjustments to accommodate the specifics of the C# language.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized by chapters, with each chapter containing multiple branches representing the incremental steps in the TDD process as described in the book.

## Branching Structure

Each chapter is represented as a separate repository folder, with branches named according to the incremental steps in the development process. For example:

 - c2/18/SoundexTest.cs represents Chapter 2, Step 18.
 - Each branch is a revision that corresponds to a stage in the book’s example progression.

## Commit Messages

Commit messages follow a specific format to mirror the book’s structure. Each commit message describes the changes made in that increment, allowing for a clear connection between the code and the narrative in the book. For example:

 - Before: Describes the context or issue before the code change.
 - After: Describes the result or outcome after the code change.

This structure is designed to facilitate the eventual integration of the adapted examples into a cohesive C#-based TDD book, whether by Jeff Langr and myself.

## Goals

 - Faithful Adaptation: Rework all examples in C# while maintaining the integrity of the original lessons and principles.
 - Comprehensive Coverage: Address all discussions in the book that are specific to C++ and translate them effectively to the C# environment.
 - Future Collaboration: Prepare the groundwork for potential future collaboration with Jeff Langr and The Pragmatic Bookshelf.
 
## Progress
 - Chapter 1: Introduction to TDD with C#
 - Chapter 2: Soundex Example in C#
 - Chapter 3: Legacy Code Refactoring (WAV Snippet Publisher) in C#
 - More chapters to follow…
